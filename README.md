# NBA 2018-19 Season Analysis

This project was used to design an interactive website with data from the 2019-19 NBA Season. We found all player stats, game stats as well as the arena data from that season. The final project has interactive maps and tables that a user can click on to get different results. For this project we used HTML, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap, Leaflet JS and Jupyter Notebooks.
